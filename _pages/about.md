Hello and welcome to my homepage! I am Yindu Su (苏银都 in Chinese), a Research Engineer at [Singapore Management University (SMU)](https://www.smu.edu.sg/) under the supervision of [Professor David LO](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/).

Prior to my current position, I was an Algorithm Engineer at [Alibaba Group](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US/). I earned my Master's degree in Computer Technology and my Bachelor's degree in Energy Engineering, both from [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **software engineering (SE)** and **natural language processing (NLP)**.
Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions or to discuss potential collaboration opportunities at <yindusu@smu.edu.sg>.
